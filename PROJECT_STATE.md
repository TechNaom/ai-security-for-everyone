# PROJECT_STATE.md — AI Security for Everyone

Last updated: 2026-08-10

## Course Objective

Teach learners (beginner → architect) to secure LLM-powered systems —
threat modeling, prompt injection/jailbreaking, data/model integrity,
securing RAG and agentic systems, red-teaming, and safe output
handling — following the TechNaom master course-building philosophy
(layered depth, story-first, production-grade, interview-ready,
original content only).

## Architecture Decisions

- **Course size: 13 chapters** (focused-topic sizing, matching every
  other course in the ecosystem).
- **Repo structure mirrors `ai-coding-agents-for-everyone`** (the most
  recent, most refined reference now): static site,
  `chapters/chapter-XX-slug/`, `docs/curriculum/`, `templates/`,
  `assessments/`, `quality-audits/`, `codebase/`. Shared front-end
  assets, templates (including `written-exam.template.html`, rendered
  as styled HTML from day one — not the raw-`.md` gap found and fixed
  in that course after user feedback), `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and
  `scripts/local_check.sh` copied from `ai-coding-agents-for-everyone`
  and rebranded. `.gitkeep` files added to all empty directories from
  the start (a bootstrap bug — git doesn't track empty directories —
  was found and fixed there; starting with `.gitkeep` already in place
  here avoids rediscovering it).
- **Chapter file pattern**: uses `python-for-everyone`'s richer
  per-chapter structure (README.md in exercises/practice/project,
  `interview-questions.md`) from Chapter 1, not the thinner
  mcp-for-everyone-derived pattern — per
  [[feedback-course-structural-reference]], this is now the
  ecosystem's preferred going-forward pattern, not just a
  Chapter-7-onward exception like it was in the prior course.
- **Model/API policy**: inherits `ai-coding-agents-for-everyone`'s
  resolved policy directly, not re-litigated — `openai` Python package
  pointed at Ollama's local OpenAI-compatible endpoint by default, zero
  cost/API key, with a documented hosted-provider-swap option. See
  `docs/course-architecture.md` for the one addition specific to this
  course: the hosted-provider option is *more* relevant here since
  testing an attack against a production model's real safety training
  is itself a legitimate reason to reach for it.
- **Ethical framing (non-negotiable, see course-architecture.md)**:
  every attack technique pairs with a real, working defense; framed as
  defensive/educational throughout; no ready-to-use exploit content
  targeting a named real-world product.

## Completed

- [x] Step 1: Discovery (course vision, personas, prerequisites,
      outcomes, modules, chapters, projects, capstone, differentiators,
      cross-course links) — captured in conversation, confirmed by the
      user, summarized in `docs/curriculum/CURRICULUM_MAP.md`.
- [x] Cross-course overlap check: confirmed via `grep` against
      `mcp-for-everyone`, `ai-coding-agents-for-everyone`,
      `genai-for-everyone`, and `rag-for-everyone`'s own curriculum
      maps that this course's scope (deep LLM-specific security) does
      not duplicate any of them — each touches security at most one
      module/chapter/session wide; this course goes deep across a full
      13 chapters, explicitly building on (not repeating) each.
- [x] Step 2: Curriculum map (`docs/curriculum/CURRICULUM_MAP.md`).
- [x] Step 3: Repository architecture scaffolded — directories (with
      `.gitkeep` from the start), templates, shared assets (rebranded:
      `AISFE_MODULES`, `AISFEProgress`, `aisfe-progress`), CI (copied
      from `ai-coding-agents-for-everyone`, already includes the
      `practice/solution.py` coverage and marker-comment conventions
      that course had to add after the fact), README, this file,
      AI_HANDOFF.md, LICENSE/LICENSE-CONTENT.
- [x] Homepage (`index.html`) and roadmap (`docs/curriculum/index.html`)
      built as part of the initial scaffold, not deferred — the prior
      course shipped 8 chapters before anyone noticed there was no
      landing page; avoided that gap here from day one.
- [x] Pushed to GitHub (`TechNaom/ai-security-for-everyone`, public),
      GitHub Pages enabled, CI Checks and Deploy GitHub Pages both
      verified green on real runners. One bootstrap bug found and
      fixed immediately: `quality-audits/.gitkeep` was missed in the
      initial `.gitkeep` pass despite being in the `mkdir` loop —
      caught by CI's `structure-check` job on the very first real run,
      same class of bug (git doesn't track empty directories) found in
      `ai-coding-agents-for-everyone`'s own first CI run.
- [x] **Chapter 1 built and live — reference chapter**: "Threat
      Modeling LLM Systems: The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications."
      Hook: GreenCart, a fictional grocery retailer whose LLM-powered
      return-triage assistant is exploited via indirect prompt
      injection through a customer-submitted text field, routing a
      fraudulent refund with no network boundary crossed. Covers the
      CURRENT OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025 edition, verified
      via research — correct category names/order/the real
      reordering from prior editions, not stale memory). Real depth on
      Prompt Injection (LLM01), Improper Output Handling (LLM05), and
      Excessive Agency (LLM06) — the three that set up the rest of the
      course — the other seven get real mechanism/example/check
      coverage. Closes with a genuine threat-modeling walkthrough (a
      real asset/category/likelihood-impact/mitigation table). Sets
      the course's non-negotiable ethical framing explicitly, in its
      own section, early. 8 exercises (4 production-gear), 8 practice
      scenarios, 8 interview questions across all 4 levels. Build was
      interrupted mid-session by an environment restart; resumed
      cleanly — prior partial work (lesson.html, quiz.html,
      interview-questions, exercises) was verified complete and kept,
      not redone.
- [x] **Chapter 2 built and live — completes Module 1**: "Mapping the
      Attack Surface of a Real LLM Feature." Teaches the systematic
      skill Chapter 1 only demonstrated once: a real, repeatable
      7-step attack-surface enumeration method (every tool, every
      context source including tool outputs, trust-classify each,
      cross-reference untrusted sources against side-effect tools,
      explicitly re-check tool outputs, run all 10 OWASP categories
      against the complete list, write the justified table). Applied
      to Waypoint, a fictional travel-booking trip-planner — a
      genuinely different shape from GreenCart (multi-turn, partner-
      data integration, payment path, six tools) — producing a 10-row
      threat model hitting every OWASP category. Names two real
      mistakes (under-scoping: a tool's OUTPUT re-enters context and
      was written by an external party, not the user; over-focusing:
      stopping after one Prompt Injection finding and missing a real
      Unbounded Consumption gap and a Supply Chain gap in the same
      system). Ships Module 1's real L1 project (AskHR, a fourth new
      scenario, validated structurally since the task is intentionally
      open-ended). 8 exercises (5 production-gear), 8 practice
      scenarios, 8 interview questions across all 4 levels.
      **Module 1 (Chapters 1-2) is now fully built and live.**
- [x] **Chapter 3 built and live — starts Module 2**: "Direct Prompt
      Injection." First chapter needing a real model; honestly
      disclosed a live-testing gap both in the audit AND directly in
      the lesson text itself (Ollama's generation endpoint hung past a
      20s timeout every attempt — the same persistent, disclosed
      sandbox-wide issue found across five prior sessions in
      `ai-coding-agents-for-everyone`). Every example transcript is
      framed as "representative of documented behavior," never as
      output observed this session. Covers the precise mechanism (no
      code-vs-data architectural separation; role weighting is trained,
      not guaranteed), a 5-family taxonomy (persona override/DAN,
      instruction override, fake authority, payload obfuscation,
      multi-turn escalation), and four real defenses each stating what
      it does/doesn't stop, including accurately-cited real provider
      research (OpenAI's Instruction Hierarchy paper, arXiv:2404.13208;
      Anthropic's XML-tag structuring and guardrails docs — both
      fetched live this session). Ships a real lab harness built to run
      for real once Ollama is reachable, with tested graceful
      degradation. 8 exercises (5 production-gear), 8 practice
      scenarios, 8 interview questions across all 4 levels. Also fixed
      a homepage inconsistency found on review: the "tested against
      real models" feature-card overclaimed relative to this chapter's
      own honest disclosure — softened to match actual practice.
- [x] **Chapter 4 built and live**: "Indirect Prompt Injection and
      Jailbreaking Techniques." Keeps Chapter 3's mechanism unchanged,
      varies who supplies the tokens and when. Hook: Northline Digest,
      a fictional internal wiki assistant where a contractor's routine
      wiki edit plants an injection three weeks before an unrelated
      employee's unrelated question happens to retrieve it — attacker
      and victim decoupled in both time and identity. Explicitly builds
      on (doesn't re-introduce) Chapters 1-2's own indirect-injection
      instances. 5-channel delivery taxonomy (RAG documents, tool/API
      output, web content, email/documents, multi-modal hidden text)
      plus jailbreaking as a distinct concept, grounded in real cited
      research: OWASP LLM01:2025, Zou et al.'s adversarial-suffix paper
      (arXiv:2307.15043), Wei/Haghtalab/Steinhardt's competing-
      objectives framing (arXiv:2307.02483). Extends all four of
      Chapter 3's defenses to the indirect/jailbreak context. Same
      Ollama generation hang as Chapter 3, same honest-disclosure
      handling (in the lesson text itself, not just the audit). 8
      exercises (5 production-gear), 8 practice scenarios, 8 interview
      questions across all 4 levels.

## Pending / Not Started

- [ ] Push to GitHub, verify CI/Pages green on real GitHub Actions
      runners (this is the immediate next step).
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` — not yet written, adapt from
      `ai-coding-agents-for-everyone`.
- [ ] Step 4: Build Chapter 1 ("Threat Modeling LLM Systems: The OWASP
      Top 10 for LLM Applications") as the reference chapter. This
      chapter is conceptual (no live-model dependency), so it does not
      block on the Ollama/model-policy question below.
- [ ] Step 5: Validate reference chapter, refine template if needed.
- [ ] Step 6: Build remaining 12 chapters module by module, validating
      after each module. Modules 1 is fully conceptual — good to build
      first. Module 2 onward (Chapter 3+) needs a real model for
      constructing/testing prompt injections — verify Ollama's current
      model recommendation and its actual behavior under
      injection/jailbreak testing before writing that content (do not
      assume a technique works against the installed model without
      testing it first).
- [ ] Step 7-8: Projects, assessments beyond per-chapter content.
- [ ] Step 9: Website — root `index.html`, styled roadmap, GitHub Pages
      deploy (`pages.yml` already staged, same as
      `ai-coding-agents-for-everyone`'s).
- [ ] Step 10: Capstone (Chapter 13).
- [ ] Step 12: Polish.

## Known Issues

- None yet — repo is freshly scaffolded, no chapter content written,
  not yet pushed to GitHub.

## Open Decisions

- **License**: MIT (code) + CC BY 4.0 (content), matching the rest of
  the ecosystem — confirmed 2026-08-10, same pattern as every sibling
  course.
- **GitHub org/publish target**: `github.com/TechNaom/ai-security-for-everyone`,
  public, `main` branch, matching every sibling course's convention —
  not yet created on GitHub, pending confirmation before push.
- **Model recommendation for injection/jailbreak testing**: not yet
  verified against Ollama's current model library — do this at the
  start of Chapter 3 (the first chapter that needs a live model), same
  research discipline as every prior course's reference chapter.

## Design Standards

See `docs/course-architecture.md` for the full standard. Chapter
completion bar matches the rest of the ecosystem (6 exercises/6
practice scenarios/8 interview questions minimum, tested code before
writing).

## Next Recommended Task

**Chapter 4 is done.** Next: Chapter 5 ("Evaluating Prompt-Injection
Defenses Honestly," Module 2, Advanced) — completes Module 2. Read
Chapters 3-4 fully first. This chapter's job per CURRICULUM_MAP.md's
own framing ("what a defense actually stops versus what it claims to
stop") is to synthesize and critically evaluate the 4+ defenses named
across Chapters 3-4 (structural separation, filtering, bounded
consequence, provider instruction hierarchy, content provenance
tagging, sandwich prompting, output-based jailbreak detection) — build
or apply a real evaluation methodology (e.g. constructing a test suite
of injection attempts and measuring a defense's actual success rate,
not just describing defenses again). This chapter should feel like the
"how do you know if any of this actually worked" payoff chapter for
the whole module. Same Ollama live-model caveat applies — check
connectivity first, disclose honestly if it still hangs. After Chapter
5, Module 2's assessment ("injection-construction + defense-evaluation
exam" per CURRICULUM_MAP.md) should be written as a real written exam
— write `assessments/written-exams/module-2-exam.html`(+`.md`) using
`templates/written-exam.template.html`.
